Python implementation of an algorithm for finding good partitions in terms of the average spacing loss (the sum of the pairwise distances between clusters). The main class can be found in `pr_clustering.py`, while `get_scores.py` contains functions to evaluate the clusters. The files `valohai.yaml` and those beginning with `val_` can be used to generate the clusters and score the results using [Valohai](https://valohai.com/).
